# share-recipes-now-backend
Backend for the share-recipes-now. Tech stack used is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) together with the [Hono.js framework](https://hono.dev/). The database in use is [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and I might also use [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) to try it out. 
## TODO
- [x] [Formulate the database](https://github.com/urostripunovic/share-recipes-now-backend/blob/main/Database.md)
- [ ] Design the [database]()
    - [ ] Look up what [index](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-index/) is and how it might improve the performance
- [ ] Reevaluate the database
- [ ] Start with researching how to setup the backend...
